Learnlist - Supplementary Assessment for CSC7062 for Ethan Crawford

•	Download XAAMP for use of Apache and MySQL, for mac MAMP would be best suited.
•	The database I used must be imported into an SQL database, and its name must be “learnlistsdb”, this can of course be changed, if the back end code is changed accordingly to match. It is also able to handle any dataset as long as it fits the correct headings.
•	The database must run on the port of 3306, as is typical for an XAAMP SQL database. The host is to be set as “localhost”, the user as “root”, the password kept blank, and the database set with the same name. If the database is changed, the ‘.env’ will also need to be changed in order to connect properly.
•	The following will need to be downloaded;
"dependencies": {
    "axios": "^1.7.2",
    "bcrypt": "^5.1.1",
    "bcryptjs": "^2.4.3",
    "cookie-parser": "^1.4.6",
    "dotenv": "^16.4.5",
    "ejs": "^3.1.10",
    "express": "^4.19.2",
    "express-session": "^1.18.0",
    "mysql": "^2.18.1",
    "mysql2": "^3.10.0"
  }
•	The website itself is hosted on ‘http://localhost:3000/’, with the landing page on, ‘http://localhost:3000/all-content’ which I would recommend navigating to in order to begin browsing the website. 
•	From there, you can navigate and view the all content page, login and then explore the additional functionality of the website.
